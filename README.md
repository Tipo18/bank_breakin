# **UI and Interactivity Project**

Welcome to the repository for my project developed for the **Computer Science Workshop - UI and Interactivity** class as part of my **Createch Engineering Major at ESILV**. This project showcases a website that connects and exchanges data with an **ESP32 card**, allowing users to monitor a **button** and a **potentiometer**. These components serve as controllers for a game that you can interact with, and both the code and illustrations were created entirely from scratch.

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to establish communication between a web interface and an ESP32 microcontroller via WebSocket, enabling real-time monitoring of hardware inputs.

## **Tools and Technologies Used**

- **ESP32 board**: home made at IFT to interact with
- **Pixilart**: For creating the game illustrations.
- **GIMP**: Used for editing and enhancing visual assets.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: The primary code editor for this project.
- **PlatformIO**: For programming and interfacing with the ESP32.

## **Acknowledgments**

I would like to thank both **Louis** for their help and guidance throughout the development of this project.

## **Contact and Feedback**

Thank you for taking an interest in my project! If you have any questions, feedback, or would like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd be happy to discuss or answer questions you may have.
